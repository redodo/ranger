# Rust solution of bloomon challenge using SIMD

This solution uses 512-bit SIMD vectors to store and compare stem stock to stem
requirements per design. The vectors that are used have 32 lanes of `u16` values. This
allows for every possible species (a to z) to have a maximum of 65535 of stock.

The feasibility of a design can be checked in a couple of operations, regardless of the
amount of stems in a design:

1. Take the maximum amount of stems we can take: `stems = simd_min(stock, design.max_stems)`
2. Check if we have enough stems: `reduce_sum(stems) >= design.total`
3. Check if we at least one of each needed stem: `!any(simd_lt(stems, design.min_stems))`

After this we have enough stems. However, since we took the maximum amount possible per
stem, we need to make sure that we return the excess amount of stems we took. This is
done over a simple iteration where stems are returned to the stock until the amount
required by the design is met.

Besides this a number of optimizations are implemented:

- On input of a stem, only designs with that stem are checked
- Total stems in stock is separately kept, and designs are skipped when the total stems
  in stock does not meet the design requirements

## How to run it

Make a release build:
```bash
cargo build --release
```

Run it:
```bash

## Benchmark of reference solution

This gets its own section because compiled languages are in a league of their own.

[reference solution](https://github.com/bloomon/code-challenge-verifier/blob/master/reference.py) (Python 3.10):

```bash
$ multitime -n10 -q -s0 -i "cat samples/1m.txt" python3.10 reference.py
===> multitime results
1: -i "cat samples/1m.txt" -q python3.10 reference.py
            Mean        Std.Dev.    Min         Median      Max
real        20.417      0.122       20.154      20.424      20.570

Curiously, the reference solution was slower in Python 3.11 ðŸ¤”
